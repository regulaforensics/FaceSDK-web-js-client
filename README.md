Face recognition as easy as reading two bytes.

 - Face Matching - Compare the person holding the ID to the person pictured in the ID document (1:1)
 - Face Recognition - Find the person by his or her photo in databases / lists (1:N)
 - Liveness Detection - Perform liveness check using a selfie taken with the userâ€™s smartphone.

## Example of Face Matching

Performing request:

```js
const face1 = fs.readFileSync('face1.jpg').buffer;
const face2 = fs.readFileSync('face2.jpg').buffer;

const sdk = new FaceSdk({ basePath: 'http://localhost:41101' });

const response = await sdk.matchingApi.match({
    images: [
        { type: ImageSource.LIVE, data: face1, index: 1 },
        { type: ImageSource.DOCUMENT_RFID, data: face2, index: 2 }
    ]
  });
```

Parsing results:
```js
for (const result of response.results) {
    console.log(`pair(${result.firstIndex},${result.secondIndex})   similarity: ${result.similarity}`)
}
```

You can find more detailed guide and run this sample in [example](https://github.com/regulaforensics/FaceSDK-web-js-client/tree/master/example) folder.
